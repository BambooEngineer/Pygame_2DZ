# Pygame_2DZ
2D Zombie Game running on pygame with Nintendo chiptunes &amp; homemade pixel images. It was a dive into OOP rather than game design but the code does whats intended and the game runs great. The Animation code was taken from a tutorial by ' Tech with Tim ', the background scroll mechanism was a modified version from the same source.

Alex.py has been updated to make it more exploration survival rather than survive endless waves, the hunter zombies chase when approached instead of chasing after spawn and player values now display on screen.
